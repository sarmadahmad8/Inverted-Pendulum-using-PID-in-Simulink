# Inverted Pendulum using PID in Simulink

The inverted pendulum is a classic control system problem that involves balancing a pendulum in an inverted position on a moving platform. This system is inherently unstable and requires a control mechanism to maintain balance.
Simulink, a graphical programming environment, was employed to create a dynamic simulation of the inverted pendulum system. Simulink provides a visual representation of the system's behavior, making it an effective tool for control system design and analysis.
Simscape, a physical modeling tool, was chosen to create a more detailed and physically accurate representation of the inverted pendulum system. Simscape allows for the modeling of multidomain physical systems, enabling a more realistic simulation.
The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm was implemented in both the Simulink and Simscape models to stabilize the inverted pendulum. PID control involves adjusting three parameters—proportional, integral, and derivative—to achieve a balance between system stability and responsiveness.
